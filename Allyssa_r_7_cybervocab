I sighn up for alot of things with quite a bit of my information and i also have a debit card and one time i found out about this 
shopping app that sold really cute clothes through my email and of course me being the girl i am i clicked on the link and it asked 
for my information and part of that information had to do with of course my credit card so i gave it not thinking one bit that this 
was a phishing email and the next day i got a email saying that i owed tons of money for things i never even bought so lets just say 
i wont be clicking on random links anymore.
